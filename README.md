### Introduction
- The base project has written Swift 5.1, you can read more new protocol of swift 5.1 like PropertyWrapper. Very cool!
- Architecture pattern: Redux + MVVM
### What is REDUX? Why do we need it?
```
Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing application state. It is most commonly used with libraries such as React or Angular for building user interfaces. Similar to Facebook's Flux architecture, it was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark.
```
- I use ReSwift to Implement Redux:

After using Redux in ReactNative and MVVM for Swift, I realized that MVVM has strengths in binding data and clean code but they are difficult to communicate with each other because of their independent properties. Redux will overcome the above disadvantages, the project will be easier to expand and easier to maintain.
